  <h1>Fair Chance Hiring: Laws, Incentives, and Employer Strategies for Second Chance Employment</h1>
  <p class="meta">By Darius Calloway, Workforce Reintegration Researcher &nbsp;|&nbsp; Research &amp; Policy Analysis &nbsp;|&nbsp; February 2026</p>

  <div class="series-nav">
    <strong>Part of the Second Chance Employment Research Series</strong>
    This is a spoke article. The <strong>main hub</strong> — the complete guide to second chance employment platforms — is at <a href="second-chance-employment-platform-guide.html">Second Chance Employment Platform: The Complete Guide</a>. Other articles in this series cover <a href="second-chance-employment-resume-reentry.html">resume development for returning citizens</a> and <a href="second-chance-employment-program-design.html">how organizations design effective reentry employment programs</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="abstract">
    This article provides a detailed analysis of fair chance hiring in the United States — covering the legal framework governing background check use in employment, ban the box legislation, federal employer incentive programs, and the practical strategies employers use to build effective second chance employment programs. It is written for HR professionals, reentry program operators, and workforce development practitioners. It does not constitute legal advice.
  </div>

  <h2>What Fair Chance Hiring Actually Means</h2>

  <p>
    Fair chance hiring is a set of practices and policies designed to give individuals with criminal records a genuine opportunity to be evaluated for employment based on their qualifications — rather than being automatically screened out because of a prior conviction or arrest. The term is often used interchangeably with "ban the box," though ban the box refers specifically to the removal of conviction history questions from initial job applications, while fair chance hiring encompasses a broader set of practices that affect the entire arc of the hiring process.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distinction matters because truly fair chance employment requires more than a delayed background check inquiry. It requires that employers who do conduct background checks apply individualized assessment — weighing the nature and circumstances of the offense, the amount of time elapsed, and the direct relevance of the conviction to the specific duties of the position — rather than applying blanket disqualification policies. It requires that employers train hiring managers to conduct that individualized assessment consistently. And it requires that the organization's stated commitment to fair chance hiring is reflected in actual hiring outcomes, not just in policy documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>The Federal Legal Framework</h2>

  <h3>EEOC Enforcement Guidance</h3>
  <p>
    The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's 2012 Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act remains the primary federal framework for assessing the legality of criminal history screening in employment. The guidance clarifies that blanket disqualification policies based on any arrest or conviction record may violate Title VII's disparate impact provisions when they disproportionately exclude individuals on the basis of race or national origin — a documented outcome given the well-established racial disparities in the US criminal justice system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The EEOC's guidance establishes a framework for individualized assessment that considers three factors: the nature and gravity of the offense; the time elapsed since the offense or completion of sentence; and the nature of the specific job sought. Employers operating in multiple states or conducting high-volume hiring are well advised to develop documented individualized assessment processes that can demonstrate compliance with this framework in the event of an EEOC inquiry or litigation.
  </p>

  <h3>The Fair Chance Act of 2019</h3>
  <p>
    The Fair Chance Act, enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, prohibits federal agencies and most federal contractors from requesting criminal history information from job applicants before extending a conditional offer of employment. The Act applies to positions filled through competitive service, positions in the excepted service at agencies with 25 or more employees, and contractor positions for which the contractor has 20 or more employees and a contract of $25,000 or more. Violations are subject to enforcement through the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council.
  </p>

  <h2>State and Local Ban the Box Laws</h2>

  <p>
    The patchwork of state and local ban the box legislation has grown substantially since the mid-2000s. As of 2026, more than 35 states and approximately 150 cities and counties have enacted some form of ban the box or fair chance hiring legislation. The specific provisions vary considerably: some statutes apply only to public employers; others extend to private employers above a headcount threshold. Some require only that the conviction history question be removed from initial applications; others mandate individualized assessment and provide appeal rights for applicants who are denied employment based on criminal history.
  </p>

  <p>
    California's Fair Chance Act is among the most comprehensive state laws, extending ban the box requirements to all employers with five or more employees and requiring individualized assessment that weighs specified factors before an adverse employment decision based on criminal history can be made. New York City's Fair Chance Act similarly imposes detailed requirements on both public and private employers. Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington, and Oregon have enacted significant fair chance hiring protections at the state level. Employers operating across multiple jurisdictions must navigate this patchwork carefully, and reentry program operators helping participants understand their rights need jurisdiction-specific information.
  </p>

  <h2>Employer Incentive Programs: WOTC and Federal Bonding</h2>

  <h3>Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)</h3>
  <p>
    The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is a federal tax incentive that provides employers with a tax credit of up to $2,400 for each qualified new hire from targeted groups facing barriers to employment, including ex-felons hired within a year of conviction or release from prison. The credit is claimed against federal income tax liability and is available to for-profit employers of any size. Employers must obtain certification from their state workforce agency that a new hire qualifies for the credit before or at the time of the hire. Despite the financial value of the WOTC, many employers — and many reentry programs — fail to systematically access it, leaving significant resources on the table.
  </p>

  <h3>Federal Bonding Program</h3>
  <p>
    The Federal Bonding Program, administered by the US Department of Labor through state workforce agencies, provides fidelity bonds to employers who hire workers with barriers to employment, including individuals with criminal records. Bonds are provided at no cost to the employer or the worker, cover the first six months of employment, and provide insurance against employee dishonesty — addressing one of the most common stated concerns among employers considering hiring individuals with records. The bond amounts are modest — typically $5,000 per worker, with higher amounts available in some cases — but the signaling value to risk-averse employers can be meaningful, particularly for roles involving financial transactions or access to sensitive assets.
  </p>

  <h2>Building an Effective Fair Chance Hiring Program</h2>

  <p>
    Employers who move beyond policy commitments to build operational fair chance hiring programs consistently identify several elements as essential to success. First, they document their individualized assessment process — creating a structured framework for how hiring managers evaluate criminal history disclosures, what factors are considered, and how decisions are made and recorded. This documentation protects the employer legally and ensures consistency across hiring decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Second, they invest in hiring manager training. The gap between an organization's stated commitment to fair chance hiring and its actual hiring outcomes is most often explained by the behavior of individual hiring managers who lack the frameworks, the information, or the organizational support to conduct individualized assessments in practice. Training that goes beyond compliance awareness to develop genuine understanding of the reentry context — who returning citizens are, what they have been through, and what they bring — produces different outcomes than perfunctory policy briefings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Third, they build relationships with reentry programs that can provide a consistent pipeline of prepared, employer-ready candidates — individuals who have received structured employment support, including resume development through tools like <a href="https://yotru.com/platform/reentry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yotru's second chance employment platform for reentry programs</a>, interview preparation, and case management that addresses the non-employment barriers to job retention. Employers who partner with reentry programs report higher retention rates among second chance hires, in part because the wraparound support that effective reentry programs provide addresses the factors that most commonly disrupt early employment.
  </p>

  <p>
    For reentry programs building the employer-ready candidate pipelines that make these partnerships work, the foundational investment is in resume quality. A returning citizen with a well-structured, ATS-ready resume that honestly and effectively presents their skills and experience will advance further in more hiring processes than one whose application materials cannot clear the first screen. Yotru's analysis of <a href="https://yotru.com/blog/how-to-handle-a-job-gap-on-your-resume-with-example-wording" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to address employment gaps on a resume</a> provides directly applicable guidance for the reentry context — where gap periods need to be acknowledged clearly, professionally, and without becoming the defining feature of the candidate's presentation.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Compliance Is the Floor, Not the Ceiling</h2>

  <p>
    Legal compliance with fair chance hiring requirements is the minimum standard — the floor below which no employer operating in a covered jurisdiction should fall. The ceiling is considerably higher: organizations that treat second chance employment as a genuine talent strategy, backed by structured processes, trained hiring managers, and meaningful employer-reentry program partnerships, consistently find that they access a motivated, loyal workforce that outperforms blanket-screening policies on retention metrics while contributing to measurable reductions in recidivism in the communities where they operate.
