  <div class="abstract">
    This article examines the structure and regulatory framework of government-funded adult vocational education in Greater Manchester, with particular attention to the £92 million devolved Adult Education Budget managed by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. It explores how devolution has reshaped provider compliance obligations, why learner employability documentation has become central to audit activity, and how platforms such as Yotru are positioned to help providers operate with consistency, rigour, and confidence in an increasingly scrutinised funding environment.
  </div>

  <h2>Introduction: Greater Manchester as a Skills Policy Proving Ground</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Manchester occupies a unique position in England's adult education landscape. As one of the first and most developed devolved regions in the country, it has operated its own Adult Education Budget since 2019, giving the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) direct control over how public skills funding is allocated, prioritised, and performance-managed across its ten constituent boroughs. This devolution settlement has made Greater Manchester a proving ground for what locally responsive, outcomes-driven adult education can look like — and it has simultaneously raised the bar for what providers operating within the region are expected to demonstrate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Greater Manchester is home to approximately 2.8 million residents and one of England's most dynamic regional economies, anchored by financial and professional services, digital technology, advanced manufacturing, health sciences, and a thriving creative sector centred on MediaCityUK. It is also a region with significant and persistent pockets of labour market disadvantage. Employment rates across the ten boroughs vary considerably, with inner-city areas of Manchester, Rochdale, and Oldham carrying above-average unemployment and elevated NEET levels. For providers serving adult learners in these communities, the pressure to deliver measurable outcomes is not merely a contractual obligation — it is a social imperative.
  </p>

  <h2>The Funding Architecture: GMCA, the Adult Education Budget, and Devolved Accountability</h2>

  <p>
    The GMCA controls £92 million in devolved adult skills funding for the 2025-26 academic year, directing provision in alignment with the region's Local Skills Improvement Plans and strategic economic priorities. This funding supports a wide range of provision delivered by further education colleges, independent training providers, and community learning organisations across Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, and Wigan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mayor Andy Burnham has consistently emphasised skills as central to Greater Manchester's economic strategy, with particular focus on digital technology, health, advanced manufacturing, and the creative economy. These priorities directly shape how providers must design, evidence, and report on their funded programmes. A provider delivering digital upskilling to unemployed adults in Salford is not simply delivering a curriculum — they are delivering against a publicly stated regional economic agenda, and they will be held accountable for whether that delivery produces genuine employment outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside the GMCA's devolved allocation, some providers in the region also access funding through the national Adult Skills Fund administered by the Department for Education. This creates a dual compliance environment in which providers must satisfy both GMCA performance management requirements and national funding rules — including accurate Individual Learner Record (ILR) submissions, learner eligibility verification, and the retention of evidence that can withstand audit scrutiny from either funding body.
  </p>

  <h2>The Compliance Landscape for Greater Manchester Providers</h2>

  <p>
    The compliance obligations facing providers in Greater Manchester are substantial and multidimensional. At the eligibility verification stage, providers must confirm that learners are aged 19 or over, resident within the GMCA area, and meet the residency and right-to-work requirements that govern funded provision. The devolution postcode dataset — published by the Department for Education — determines whether a given learner is funded by the GMCA or by the national DfE allocation, and errors at this stage are a persistent source of funding clawback in audit activity across the region.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond eligibility, providers must demonstrate that their programmes are delivering against the outcomes that GMCA has commissioned. This means maintaining evidence not just of enrolment and attendance but of learner progression: the skills gained, the qualifications achieved, and — increasingly — the employment or further learning destinations reached by programme completers. Ofsted inspection under the Education Inspection Framework further requires that providers can evidence personal development and career readiness alongside academic and vocational achievement.
  </p>

  <p>
    For many providers, particularly smaller independent training organisations and community-based providers who form a vital part of Greater Manchester's skills ecosystem, the documentation burden this creates is real and significant. The gap between what is delivered and what can be evidenced remains one of the most common vulnerabilities identified in audit and inspection activity.
  </p>

  <h2>Greater Manchester's Provider Ecosystem: Scale and Diversity</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Manchester is served by one of the largest and most diverse provider ecosystems in England. The Manchester College, with over 20,000 learners annually across eight campuses, is one of the UK's largest further education institutions and a cornerstone AEB provider for the region. Bolton College, Stockport College, Trafford College Group, Oldham College, Wigan and Leigh College, and Tameside College collectively serve tens of thousands of adult learners each year, with provision ranging from entry-level English and maths through to Level 4 and 5 technical qualifications.
  </p>

  <p>
    The region is also home to a vibrant ecosystem of digital and technology training specialists — organisations such as CodeNation, Tech Returners, Manchester Digital, and LaunchPad — that deliver skills bootcamps, employer-led programmes, and AEB-funded provision targeting adults seeking to enter or progress within the tech sector. These providers often work with learner cohorts that are highly motivated but may lack the professional documentation and self-presentation skills needed to convert newly acquired technical capabilities into successful job applications. Structured employability support, including CV development, is therefore not supplementary to their provision — it is integral to it.
  </p>

  <h2>Employability Documentation: A Compliance Gap with Real Consequences</h2>

  <p>
    Across the Greater Manchester provider landscape, employability development — and particularly CV documentation — remains one of the least consistently evidenced areas of funded provision. The Gatsby Benchmarks, embedded in statutory guidance for further education colleges and independent training providers, require that all learners receive personalised guidance, access to labour market information, and support in understanding and navigating employment pathways. For adult vocational learners, this guidance must be calibrated to their specific circumstances: prior work history, sector aspirations, caring responsibilities, and the particular demands of Greater Manchester's labour market.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet in practice, the documentation of this activity is often fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to retrieve when required for audit. A tutor who spends an afternoon helping a cohort of adult learners develop their CVs may produce genuine educational value but leave no traceable evidence that the activity occurred, what it contained, or how it connected to the funded programme's stated aims. When an auditor or Ofsted inspector asks for evidence of systematic employability support, providers without structured documentation systems are left unable to demonstrate work that was genuinely done.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not merely a record-keeping inconvenience. For providers holding GMCA AEB contracts, the inability to evidence employability delivery can call into question the validity of their funding claims, trigger performance management processes, and in serious cases lead to contract termination. The stakes of documentation failure are high, and they are avoidable.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology as Infrastructure for Compliance and Quality</h2>

  <p>
    The response to this challenge, for providers that have taken it seriously, has involved investing in platforms that can systematise and standardise employability support delivery across entire learner cohorts. Rather than relying on individual tutors to deliver ad hoc CV guidance, forward-thinking providers are deploying structured tools that produce consistent, employer-aligned CV outputs while generating the time-stamped documentation trails needed to evidence learner engagement and progression.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yotru is built specifically for this purpose. Designed for training providers, further education institutions, and workforce development programmes, Yotru enables providers to deliver structured CV development at scale — producing outputs that are consistent, employer-readable, and aligned with the labour market priorities of the region in which learners are seeking work. For Greater Manchester providers, this means CVs that reflect the digital, manufacturing, and health sector demands of the local economy, backed by documentation that satisfies the audit and inspection requirements of both the GMCA and Ofsted. Providers and educational institutions can learn more about the platform's capabilities at <a href="https://yotru.com/platform/educators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yotru.com/platform/educators</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Connecting Compliance to Learner Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    It is important to resist the framing that positions compliance documentation as somehow separate from educational quality. The two are not in tension — they are expressions of the same commitment to genuine learner outcomes. A provider that can produce consistent, high-quality CV evidence for every learner in a funded cohort is, almost by definition, a provider that has delivered genuine employability support. The documentation is the proof of the pudding.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Greater Manchester's adult learners — many of whom are returning to education and employment after periods of economic inactivity, career change, or disadvantage — the quality of their self-presentation in the labour market is a genuine determinant of their employment outcomes. A professionally developed, employer-aligned CV that accurately and compellingly represents a learner's skills and experience is not a minor administrative output. It is a meaningful asset in a competitive regional labour market.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers that invest in the infrastructure to produce these assets systematically — and to document that production consistently — are doing right by their learners, by their funders, and by their own institutional futures.

  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Audit Readiness as Regional Responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    Greater Manchester's devolved skills system is one of the most ambitious and carefully constructed in England. It represents a genuine attempt to align public investment in adult education with the specific economic and social needs of a major city-region. For providers operating within that system, the privilege of accessing devolved funding carries a corresponding responsibility: to deliver against stated outcomes, to document that delivery rigorously, and to be prepared to demonstrate — at any point, to any auditor or inspector — that the investment has produced real value for real learners.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meeting that responsibility requires more than good intentions and capable teaching staff. It requires systems and platforms that bring consistency, standardisation, and auditability to every stage of the learner journey. For the employability strand of funded provision, those systems are now a necessity rather than a luxury. Providers that have invested in them are better placed in audit, better positioned in inspection, and better equipped to serve the adult learners of Greater Manchester as the region continues to define what devolved skills delivery can achieve.
