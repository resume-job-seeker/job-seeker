  <h1>Adult Vocational Education in the Midlands: Government Funding, Compliance Pressures, and the Case for Audit-Ready Learner Documentation</h1>

  <p class="meta">
    By Seán Flanagan, Workforce Development Researcher &nbsp;|&nbsp; Research &amp; Policy Analysis &nbsp;|&nbsp; February 2026
  </p>

  <div class="abstract">
    This article examines the structure and regulatory framework of government-funded adult vocational education in England, with a focus on the Midlands region. It explores how the transition from the Adult Education Budget to the Adult Skills Fund has intensified compliance obligations for training providers, why employability evidence has moved to the centre of audit activity, and how platforms such as Yotru are positioned to help providers meet these demands systematically and at scale.
  </div>

  <h2>Introduction: The Scale and Stakes of Adult Vocational Education in England</h2>

  <p>
    England's adult vocational education system is one of the most complex publicly funded ecosystems in Europe. Tens of thousands of adults each year enter programmes delivered by further education colleges, independent training providers, and community learning organisations, with the explicit goal of gaining skills, qualifications, and employment outcomes that reduce reliance on welfare and support regional economic productivity. The government invests billions annually in this provision, and with that investment comes a rigorous framework of accountability, inspection, and financial audit.
  </p>

  <p>
    For learners, the stakes are personal: a meaningful qualification, a credible CV, and a viable path into work. For providers, the stakes are institutional: funding contract continuity, Ofsted grade, and organisational reputation. When these two sets of interests align well, the system works. When documentation, evidence, and learner outcome tracking are inadequate, the system breaks down — and providers face funding clawback, performance intervention, or worse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Midlands, particularly the West Midlands, sits at the epicentre of this dynamic. With over 100,000 learners served annually across Birmingham, the Black Country, Coventry, and Warwickshire, the region is one of England's largest and most diverse vocational education markets. It is also a region where the pressure to demonstrate outcomes — not merely delivery — has never been higher.
  </p>

  <h2>The Funding Framework: From AEB to the Adult Skills Fund</h2>

  <p>
    From the 2024-25 academic year, the Adult Education Budget (AEB) was formally replaced by the Adult Skills Fund (ASF). Administered by the Department for Education following the closure of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) in March 2025, the ASF represents the primary public funding stream for adult education and training in England for learners aged 19 and above. It funds a wide range of provision including regulated qualifications, English and maths, essential digital skills, and community learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the West Midlands, the regional devolution settlement means that a significant portion of adult skills funding is managed through the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA), which holds devolved AEB responsibility for the region. This creates a two-tier funding structure: providers must satisfy both the national regulatory framework set by the DfE and the regional commissioning priorities of the WMCA. Birmingham, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, and the Black Country boroughs each have their own labour market characteristics, NEET levels, and skills gap priorities that inform how devolved funds are deployed and what outcomes are expected from providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eligibility conditions under the ASF are tightly defined. Learners must typically be aged 19 or over, resident in the relevant area for at least three years, and meet specific prior attainment thresholds. Providers are required to verify and document eligibility before enrolling any funded learner. Failures in eligibility verification are one of the most common sources of funding clawback identified in audit activity, and they are almost entirely preventable with robust intake processes.
  </p>

  <h2>What Ofsted and Audit Bodies Actually Look For</h2>

  <p>
    The Education Inspection Framework (EIF), under which Ofsted inspects further education and skills providers, places significant weight on personal development and learner outcomes. Inspectors are not merely interested in whether a provider has delivered a qualification programme — they want to understand whether learners are making progress as whole individuals: developing the skills, behaviours, and employability attributes needed to succeed in work and life. For adult vocational learners, this means demonstrating not just course completion but genuine career readiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Audit bodies tasked with scrutinising ASF claims look at a related but distinct set of evidence. They examine learner records for completeness and accuracy, check that claims align with actual delivery, and increasingly ask for evidence of learner progression and destination outcomes. A provider that can show a learner enrolled, attended, completed, and moved into employment — with consistent documentation at every stage — is in a fundamentally stronger position than one that can only demonstrate enrolment and attendance.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates a documentation challenge that many providers, particularly small independent training organisations, find difficult to meet consistently. The burden of evidence has grown considerably in recent years. What was once a relatively straightforward administrative process — signing enrolment forms, recording attendance, issuing certificates — now requires a coherent, learner-centred evidence trail that demonstrates progression toward real employment outcomes. The gap between what providers deliver and what they can prove they deliver is, in many cases, the single greatest compliance risk they face.
  </p>

  <h2>Employability Documentation: The Missing Link in Many Funded Programmes</h2>

  <p>
    One area where this documentation gap is particularly acute is employability development. Funded providers delivering vocational programmes are expected to support learners not just with technical skills, but with the broader competencies needed to enter or progress in employment: communication, self-presentation, job application skills, and professional CV writing. The Gatsby Benchmarks — the eight-point framework that defines world-class careers guidance in England, now embedded in statutory guidance for further education colleges and independent training providers — explicitly require that learners receive personalised guidance and labour market information, and that providers can evidence this delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet in practice, CV development and employability coaching are among the least consistently documented areas of funded provision. Delivery often happens informally, varies between tutors, and produces outputs — if any are produced at all — that are inconsistent, unstandardised, and difficult to retain as evidence. When an auditor asks for evidence that a cohort of adult learners received systematic employability support, many providers find themselves unable to produce it in any meaningful form.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a minor gap. For providers in the West Midlands working with disadvantaged adult learners — those returning to education after long periods of unemployment, those transitioning from low-skill sectors, those seeking to move off welfare and into sustainable work — employability documentation is both a compliance requirement and a genuine indicator of programme quality. The two are inseparable.
  </p>

  <h2>The West Midlands Context: Scale, Diversity, and Demand</h2>

  <p>
    The West Midlands is home to a highly diverse adult learner population with complex employment needs. The region has historically carried above-average unemployment rates compared to the national England average, and certain subregions — particularly parts of Sandwell, Wolverhampton, and Birmingham — have experienced persistent labour market disadvantage linked to industrial decline, low qualification levels, and barriers to progression including language, disability, and caring responsibilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Major providers serving adult vocational learners across the region include Walsall College, Dudley College, Sandwell College, Halesowen College, Birmingham Metropolitan College (BMet), South and City College Birmingham, In-Comm Training, Netcom Training, and Performance Through People. Together, they serve a learner population that is markedly different from the 16-18 cohort: adults bring prior work experience, complex personal circumstances, and highly specific employment goals. They need provision that is responsive, outcomes-focused, and backed by documentation systems that can keep pace with the intensity of funded delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The WMCA's skills investment priorities further shape the landscape. With the region having committed significant resource to its AI Academy and digital upskilling agenda, and with sectors including advanced manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and construction remaining dominant employers, providers must not only deliver relevant vocational content but evidence that their learners are being equipped with employer-ready documentation that reflects those sector priorities.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Adult Learners Need Differently Calibrated Employability Support</h2>

  <p>
    It is important to recognise that adult vocational learners are not a homogeneous group, and their employability needs differ substantially from younger learners. Many adults returning to education have periods of employment history that must be presented carefully and accurately on a CV. They may have informal skills, caring experience, or voluntary work that is relevant but rarely documented in any structured way. They may be applying to competitive labour markets with significantly higher qualification expectations than when they last entered work. And they frequently face confidence barriers that mean the quality of their self-presentation lags well behind the quality of their actual skills and experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Standard CV templates and one-off employability workshops are not sufficient for this population. What is required is a systematic, cohort-wide approach to CV development that captures learner progress, produces employer-readable outputs, and generates documentation that a provider can retain as evidence of employability delivery. This is not a luxury or an add-on. For providers claiming ASF funding for employability-embedded programmes, it is a compliance necessity.
  </p>

  <h2>The Role of Technology Platforms in Closing the Evidence Gap</h2>

  <p>
    The response to this challenge across the sector has increasingly involved the adoption of technology platforms that can standardise and systematise the employability support process. Rather than relying on individual tutors to produce bespoke CV workshops with uneven outputs, forward-thinking providers are turning to structured platforms that can deliver consistent, auditable, employer-aligned CV development across entire learner cohorts.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shift reflects a broader maturation in how providers think about quality assurance. Just as management information systems (MIS) brought consistency to enrolment and attendance recording, and just as e-portfolio systems created auditable evidence trails for vocational assessments, dedicated employability platforms are now being recognised as essential infrastructure for compliance-conscious providers delivering funded adult vocational programmes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yotru is one such platform. Developed specifically for training providers, further education institutions, and workforce development programmes, Yotru enables providers to deliver standardised CV development at scale — producing consistent, employer-readable outputs across cohorts while generating the documentation trails needed to evidence employability delivery. For West Midlands providers working within the WMCA's devolved funding framework, this kind of systematic approach to learner outcome documentation is increasingly not optional but foundational.

  </p>

  <h2>Compliance as a Quality Indicator, Not a Burden</h2>

  <p>
    There is a persistent tendency in the sector to frame compliance as bureaucratic overhead — something that sits alongside real educational work rather than being integral to it. This framing is both inaccurate and operationally dangerous. The documentation requirements of the ASF and the EIF are not arbitrary: they exist because public money is being invested in outcomes that matter to learners, employers, and communities. The evidence trail is the proof that the investment is working.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers that reframe compliance as a quality signal — that treat the ability to produce comprehensive, coherent learner evidence as a mark of programme excellence rather than an administrative imposition — are consistently better placed in inspection, in audit, and in contract renewal conversations with commissioning bodies. They are also, not coincidentally, the providers that tend to produce better learner outcomes, because the systems that generate compliance documentation also generate the data needed for continuous improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    As detailed in Yotru's analysis of the Adult Skills Fund compliance landscape, the three interconnected areas of funding compliance — learner eligibility verification, correct funding rate application, and evidence that can withstand audit scrutiny — all require providers to invest in infrastructure, not just intent. For employability-related provision, that infrastructure increasingly means platforms that can produce, standardise, and retain CV and career development evidence across the full learner journey. Providers who have not yet addressed this gap are carrying a compliance risk that will not diminish as audit intensity increases.

  </p>

  <p>
    The picture across the West Midlands is similarly detailed. The region's provider ecosystem — spanning major FE colleges, specialist ITPs, and community learning organisations — is well mapped, and the expectations placed on providers by both the WMCA and national frameworks are well understood. What varies is the degree to which individual organisations have invested in the systems and processes needed to meet those expectations consistently. Yotru's directory of <a href="https://yotru.com/blog/west-midlands-training-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Midlands training providers for 2026</a> offers a practical overview of the regional landscape for organisations benchmarking their own provision or seeking partnership opportunities.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Audit Readiness Is an Institutional Capability</h2>

  <p>
    The English adult vocational education system in 2026 operates in an environment of heightened accountability. The transition to the Adult Skills Fund, the ongoing evolution of the Gatsby Benchmarks, and the increasing scrutiny applied to learner destination outcomes have collectively raised the floor for what constitutes adequate compliance. Providers in the Midlands — operating within one of England's most complex and consequential regional skills markets — face these pressures acutely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Audit readiness is no longer a matter of having the right paperwork in a filing cabinet. It is an institutional capability built from robust systems, standardised processes, and consistent evidence generation across the full learner journey. For the employability strand of funded provision, that capability is increasingly delivered through dedicated platforms that remove the variability, inconsistency, and documentation gaps that leave providers exposed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Organisations that invest in these capabilities now are not simply protecting themselves against audit risk. They are building the foundations for genuinely improved learner outcomes — and in doing so, they are fulfilling the real purpose of publicly funded vocational education: giving adults the skills, confidence, and documentation to move into sustainable, rewarding employment.
