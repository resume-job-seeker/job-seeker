  <h1>Adult Vocational Education in England: Government Funding, Compliance, and the Case for Audit-Ready Learner Documentation</h1>

  <p class="meta">By Seán Flanagan, Workforce Development Researcher &nbsp;|&nbsp; Research &amp; Policy Analysis &nbsp;|&nbsp; February 2026</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    This page serves as the central research hub for a series of regional articles examining government-funded adult vocational education across England's major devolved regions. Each article analyses how the Adult Skills Fund, regional Combined Authority accountability frameworks, and Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework together create compliance obligations for training providers — and why structured, auditable employability documentation, including professional CV development, has become essential for providers seeking to protect their funding and demonstrate genuine learner outcomes.
  </div>

  <h2>About This Series</h2>

  <p>
    England's adult vocational education system is administered through a combination of national funding rules and devolved regional authority. Since the introduction of devolved Adult Education Budgets to Mayoral Combined Authorities, training providers in major city-regions must satisfy both national compliance standards and the specific performance management requirements of their regional funder. The result is a funding landscape of considerable complexity — and a compliance burden that demands systematic, evidence-based responses from every provider that holds a public contract.
  </p>

  <p>
    This research series examines that landscape region by region, with a focus on how providers can build and maintain the institutional capability to remain audit-ready. The <strong>featured article</strong> in this series focuses on the <strong>West Midlands</strong> — one of England's largest and most diverse regional skills markets — and establishes the analytical framework applied across all regional studies. The four <strong>regional articles</strong> apply that framework to Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, West Yorkshire, and Greater London, each drawing on region-specific funding data, provider context, and labour market characteristics.
  </p>

  <p>
    All articles in this series reference <a href="https://yotru.com/platform/educators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yotru's platform for educators and training providers</a>, which is designed to help funded providers deliver structured, employer-aligned CV development at scale while generating the documentation trails needed to evidence employability delivery to funders and inspectors.

  <h2>The National Framework: What Every Funded Provider Must Understand</h2>

  <p>
    Across all five regions covered in this series, providers delivering government-funded adult vocational education are accountable to a shared national framework of compliance obligations. The Adult Skills Fund, which replaced the Adult Education Budget from the 2024-25 academic year, is the primary funding stream for adult education in England for learners aged 19 and over. It is administered by the Department for Education and, in devolved regions, channelled through Mayoral Combined Authorities that have taken on responsibility for strategic skills investment in their areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    The compliance obligations that flow from this funding are threefold. First, providers must verify and document learner eligibility before enrolment — confirming age, residency, right to work, and prior attainment where relevant. Second, they must apply correct funding rates and models, accurately coding their Individual Learner Record submissions to reflect the funding source, qualification type, and learner characteristics that govern each claim. Third, and increasingly, they must maintain evidence that their provision is producing genuine learner outcomes — not merely enrolment and attendance records but documentation of skills development, employability progression, and destination data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ofsted's Education Inspection Framework adds a further dimension to this accountability: the expectation that providers can demonstrate the quality of personal development and career readiness support alongside academic and vocational achievement. For adult vocational learners, this means structured, documented employability support — including CV development — that is delivered consistently, retained as evidence, and calibrated to the specific labour market conditions of the region in which learners are seeking work.
  </p>

  <h2>The Employability Documentation Gap: A Cross-Regional Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    One theme runs consistently through each of the regional studies in this series: the gap between the quality of employability support that funded providers deliver and their ability to evidence that support in a form that satisfies audit and inspection requirements. This gap is not unique to any single region. It reflects a systemic weakness in how the sector has historically approached the documentation of careers guidance, CV development, and employability coaching — activities that are integral to the purpose of funded adult vocational education but that have rarely been treated with the same rigour as formal assessment and qualification recording.
  </p>

  <p>
    The consequences of this gap are real and serious. For providers, undocumented employability delivery is invisible to auditors and inspectors, regardless of its actual quality. For learners, the absence of structured, consistently delivered employability support — even where individual tutors are committed and capable — means that outcomes vary significantly between cohorts, campuses, and delivery teams. And for the public funding that underwrites all of this provision, undocumented delivery is effectively unaccountable delivery: expenditure whose outcomes cannot be demonstrated and therefore cannot be defended.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solution lies not in adding to the administrative burden of frontline staff but in deploying platforms that embed documentation into the delivery process itself — that make structured, employer-aligned CV development a standard, consistent feature of every funded programme, producing outputs that serve learners in the labour market and providers in the audit room simultaneously. Yotru is designed for precisely this purpose. Providers and educational institutions can explore what the platform offers at <a href="https://yotru.com/platform/educators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yotru.com/platform/educators</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use This Research Series</h2>

  <p>
    Each article in this series is written to stand alone as a reference resource for training providers, quality and compliance teams, programme leads, and policymakers operating in the relevant region. Readers with a specific regional focus are encouraged to read the regional article most relevant to their context alongside the West Midlands main article, which provides the most detailed treatment of the underlying compliance framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    Readers with cross-regional responsibilities — multi-site providers, national ITPs, or policymakers working across devolved boundaries — will find value in reading the series as a whole, as the regional comparisons illuminate both the common compliance obligations that apply nationally and the distinctive pressures that devolved funding arrangements create in each area.
