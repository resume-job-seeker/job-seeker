  <h1>Personal Resume Writer & Career Development Journal</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Documenting real experience, practical ideas, and honest work in modern job searching.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a personal resume and job application writer focused on helping people present their skills clearly, honestly, and effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is where I document my experiences, ideas, experiments, and lessons learned from working in career development, resume writing, and professional growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, I share practical insights about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Writing strong, ATS-friendly resumes</li>
    <li>Improving job applications and cover letters</li>
    <li>Career transitions and upskilling</li>
    <li>Interview preparation</li>
    <li>Long-term career planning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My goal is to build a transparent, experience-based resource for job seekers who want realistic guidance instead of generic advice.
  </p>

  <p>
    New notes, case studies, and articles will be added regularly.
